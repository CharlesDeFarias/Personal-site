            <h3>Curious, effecient & resourceful coder</h3>
            <p>I was blessed with the immense privilige of having participated in the Resilient Coders' bootcamp and having a logical way of thinking since childhood. The pleasure center in my brain that used to be satisfied by crosswords and video games are now scratched silly by creating something new, learning another programming language or gaining greater mastery in the ones I already know. I am perpetually dedicated to making my code better, smarter and shorter. I strive to impress not just my superiors, but also myself. The only thing better than figuring out why something broke is figuring out how to make it better.</p>
            <p>I have a particular passion for the endless potential that comes from the simple combination of HTML5, CSS and ES6. I'm also experienced with MongoDB, Node & React. I plan on becoming much more familiar with React due to its versatility. </p>
            <h3>Positive, authentic & humorous office presence</h3>
            <p>I am consistently dedicated to improving the day of as many people as possible. While I can be oddly cold and calculative when it comes to making decisions, I am extremely invested in the happiness & success of those around me. Since college, I have learned to create a community wherever I land. I've learned how to form a bond with just about anyone and have that bond be a positive element in both our lives. I'm dedicated you creating, fostering and maintaining positive & uplifting relationships </p>
            <h3>Charismatic, enthusiastic and loyal brand ambassador</h3>
            <p>I was raised to always acknowledge, respect & praise my privilige. I know that even what I achieve through my hard work and intellect is a result of the luck I had in being born to the family and time I was born into. For this reason, I always give my all to any opportunity granted to me. Whether that be a bootcamp like the glorious Resilient Coders or an employer that values me, I will always do my best to make sure both they and the world know how much I appreciate them.</p>

                <h4>JWLI Website Recreation</h4>
                <p>A screenshot of a website was provided and I recreated it using HTML5 and CSS3 as well as made responsive. There's still plenty of work I could do on it now and shall do in the future, but it was a great lesson in CSS and responsiveness.

                <h4>Slot Machine</h4>
                <p>This project's goal was to create a slot-machine with 3 reels, each with 5 options. The user is able to make a minimum and maximum bet, both of which have different payouts. Upon winning or losing, a message is presented. I want to add many more features, such as have users input their starting bank and then bet different, pre-set amounts that have different pay-offs and different success rates, have them styled to display in a way where each reel displays 3 options to look more like a slot machine. I could also have effects when winning or losing, like spinning elements and some sort of confetti and a sound and I could add a jackpot reel option that pays out much more than the others but is also much less frequent.

                <h4>Image Carousel</h4>
                <p>This is another simple, but often used web application that allows users to click a button to see the next image in a series of images. The trickiest part of this project was getting it so clicking "next" on the last image brings you to the first image, and clicking "back" on the first image brings you to the last image. While not a particularly impressive app, this was a great practice in Javascript and will be a feature I'll be using often in one way or another.</p>
